### RDNR
```
The Render Network (RNDR) is a distributed GPU rendering network that   
facilitates a compute marketplace between providers and requestors.  
It allows people to contribute unused GPU processing power   
to produce motion graphics and visual effects for projects12.   
The Render Network is the first network to transform the power of GPU compute into a decentralized economy of connected 3D assets3.  
In general, rendering networks are used to distribute the rendering process of a 3D model across multiple computers,   
which can help to speed up the process and reduce the time it takes to render a scene4.
