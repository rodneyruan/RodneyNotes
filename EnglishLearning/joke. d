### Two and and a tiger
```
Two men are walking through a forest.  Suddenly, they see a tiger in the distance, running towards them.
They turn and start running away.  But then one of them stops, takes some running shoes from his bag, and starts putting them on.
“What are you doing?” says the other man.  “Do you think you will run faster than the tiger with those?”
“I don’t have to run faster than the tiger,” he says.  “I just have to run faster than you.”
```
