Do you want to be a movie star?
No, i don't want to be a movie star,I think it would be very stressful to be a movie star, even if their life may seem quite glamorous.
Movie stars often get.Have little privacy.
Their personal lives are in the public eye.
Their personal lives are in the public eye.
Well, it may seem glamorous and exciting to be in the spotlight. I prefer a quieter and more private life


My favorite color of clothes is blue, i just find it To be a soothing and Versatile color That goes well with many styles and colors.
A lot of my clothes are a shade of blue.

I never wear clothes with really elaborate designs or loud , bright colours，I prefer to keep my wardrobe simple. because 
i don't want to draw too much attention to my clothing。
Also i never wear anything too formal. Like a suit or Tuxedo

I usually wear casual and comfortable clothing. Like t shirts, jeans. And sneakers.I like to be comfortable in my clothing, and feel relaxed in what i'm wearing.
During the week i tend to wear more formal or business casual clothes.
For example, button up shirts.
On the weekend i prefer to wear More comfortable and relaxed clothing.
Like Sweat pants And a hoodie.



The place where i'm able to relax and unwind the most is a small park near my home. The park is just down the road from my apartment.Not far from the main walking street.Which is busy at all hours of the day.
