#### Task 1
```
Dear sir,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to draw your attention to a heating issue in my apartment.
I am writing to bring to your immediate attention the persistent issues with the heating and hot water in my apartment.

Despite your previous attempts to resolve these problems, the heating system continues to malfunction, and the hot water supply remains inconsistent.
This has been particularly challenging during the recent cold weather, as the apartmentâ€™s temperature has dropped to uncomfortable levels,
making it difficult to maintain a livable environment.

Obviously, this situation is unacceptable, and so we ask that you give the matter your prompt attention.
Temporarily moving to a vacant apartment in the building while the heating is being fixed would be a welcome alternative.

I am deeply concerned about the impact this is having on my daily life and well-being. The low temperatures are not only uncomfortable but also pose a risk to my health.
I kindly request that a professional technician be sent to thoroughly inspect and repair the heating and hot water systems as soon as possible.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to your swift response and a permanent resolution to these issues.
```
