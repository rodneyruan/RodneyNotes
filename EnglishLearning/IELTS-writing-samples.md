#### Task 1

Dear sir,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to draw your attention to a heating issue in my apartment.
I am writing to bring to your immediate attention the persistent issues with the heating and hot water in my apartment.

Despite your previous attempts to resolve these problems, the heating system continues to malfunction, and the hot water supply remains inconsistent.
This has been particularly challenging during the recent cold weather, as the apartment’s temperature has dropped to uncomfortable levels,
making it difficult to maintain a livable environment.

Obviously, this situation is unacceptable, and so we ask that you give the matter your prompt attention.
Temporarily moving to a vacant apartment in the building while the heating is being fixed would be a welcome alternative.

I am deeply concerned about the impact this is having on my daily life and well-being. The low temperatures are not only uncomfortable but also pose a risk to my health.
I kindly request that a professional technician be sent to thoroughly inspect and repair the heating and hot water systems as soon as possible.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to your swift response and a permanent resolution to these issues.

Dear Mr. Smith,

I am writing to complain about your bank’s service and to track down my new cheque book. 

Three weeks ago I filled out the appropriate order form for a cheque book and paid with cash. I was assured that it would be delivered to my home within six business days.

It has now been three weeks since my order, and I have some urgent bills to pay. I have tried calling the bank several times, but no-one seems to be able to tell me anything about my cheques.

Please let me know how much longer I will have to wait and what can be done in the meantime to cover my bills. As a new customer, I am stunned at your bank’s inefficiency and am beginning to wonder whether another bank would make me feel more valued.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my frustration and disappointment regarding the delayed delivery of my new cheque book, which I ordered three weeks ago. Despite the bank’s assurance of a prompt delivery, I have yet to receive it.

I paid for the cheque book through my savings account (Account Number: [Your Account Number]) on [Date of Payment]. The amount was promptly deducted, but the cheque book has not arrived, causing significant inconvenience.

Could you please investigate this matter urgently and provide an update on the status of my cheque book? Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could expedite the delivery process or suggest an alternative solution to ensure I receive it as soon as possible.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to your swift response.
