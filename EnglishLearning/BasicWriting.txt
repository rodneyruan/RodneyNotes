I live in a house on a quiet street.
It’s not far from  the town centre and it’s a twenty-minute walk to the train station. 
There is a bus stop near the house.
The house has got a living room with a large sofa and a television.
There’s also a large kitchen  with a table and three chairs.
In the kitchen,  there is a washing machine, a dishwasher and a fridge-freezer. 
outside, there’s a small garden behind the house.
Upstairs,there are two bedrooms. 
The main bedroom is big. It has got a double bed, a desk and a wardrobe. The guest bedroom only has a single bed. 
There’s one bathroom,  but it doesn’t have a bath. It just has a shower.


Last night, I was walking (walk) home when I saw (see) a car running very fast towards a red light.
I looked (look) at the driver and I could see that he was talking (talk) on his phone.
He didn’t stop (not stop) at the traffic light, and another car crashed (crash) into him and killed (kill) him. 
When the police arrived they asked me what had happened (happen) 
and I told (tell) them that the driver hadn’t seen (not see) the traffic light because he was on his phone.
