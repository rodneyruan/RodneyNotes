I live in a house on a quiet street.
It’s not far from  the town centre and it’s a twenty-minute walk to the train station. 
There is a bus stop near the house.
The house has got a living room with a large sofa and a television.
There’s also a large kitchen  with a table and three chairs.
In the kitchen,  there is a washing machine, a dishwasher and a fridge-freezer. 
outside, there’s a small garden behind the house.
Upstairs,there are two bedrooms. 
The main bedroom is big. It has got a double bed, a desk and a wardrobe. The guest bedroom only has a single bed. 
There’s one bathroom,  but it doesn’t have a bath. It just has a shower.
