I live in a house on a quiet street.
It’s not far from  the town centre and it’s a twenty-minute walk to the train station. 
There is a bus stop near the house.
The house has got a living room with a large sofa and a television.
There’s also a large kitchen  with a table and three chairs.
In the kitchen,  there is a washing machine, a dishwasher and a fridge-freezer. 
outside, there’s a small garden behind the house.
Upstairs,there are two bedrooms. 
The main bedroom is big. It has got a double bed, a desk and a wardrobe. The guest bedroom only has a single bed. 
There’s one bathroom,  but it doesn’t have a bath. It just has a shower.


Last night, I was walking (walk) home when I saw (see) a car running very fast towards a red light.
I looked (look) at the driver and I could see that he was talking (talk) on his phone.
He didn’t stop (not stop) at the traffic light, and another car crashed (crash) into him and killed (kill) him. 
When the police arrived they asked me what had happened (happen) 
and I told (tell) them that the driver hadn’t seen (not see) the traffic light because he was on his phone.


Many years ago, I 1 
 (travel) along Central America with a friend. We 2 
 (travel) across Honduras for a couple of days when we 3 
 (arrive) at the border with Nicaragua. When we 4 
 (show) our passports to the border officers, they 5 
 (tell) us that in order to cross the border we had to pay some money; it wasn’t much, maybe a couple of dollars.

"What?" I said. I couldn't believe it. We didn’t have any money, because we 6 
 (see) any banks in the few villages we 7 
 (visit) along the way. We had a credit card, but it was Sunday and the banks were closed, so we couldn’t take out any money in the nearby villages. We 8 
 (beg) the officers to let us cross, but they just wanted to get their four dollars and they didn't care if we had to stay there the whole weekend.

We 9 
 (stand) there, next to the officers, when an old man dressed in very old and dirty clothes 10 
 (say), “I’ll pay the taxes for these two young men.” We were amazed. That man looked very poor, the kind of person for whom 4 dollars could be a big deal. “We don’t know how to thank you,” I said. And he replied, “A la mano que da, nunca le falta de nada”, which means something like 'A giving hand never goes empty'.

 Once upon a time, in a small town nestled in the mountains, there was a young boy named Max who had a deep passion for basketball. Max had been playing basketball since he was just four years old and had a natural talent for the game.

Max would spend every spare moment practicing his moves and perfecting his shots, dreaming of one day becoming a professional basketball player. His dedication to the sport was unwavering, and he would often stay up late watching basketball games and studying the techniques of his favorite players.

As Max grew older, his skills on the court continued to improve, and he became a star player on his high school basketball team. His talent did not go unnoticed, and he was soon scouted by a college basketball coach who offered him a full scholarship to play for their team.

Max's dream of playing basketball at the college level had become a reality, and he was determined to make the most of this opportunity. He worked tirelessly, honing his skills and leading his team to victory after victory.

As Max's college career came to an end, he was scouted by a professional basketball team and was offered a spot on their roster. Max could hardly believe it - his childhood dream of becoming a professional basketball player was finally coming true.

Max's first season in the pros was a rollercoaster ride of ups and downs, but he never gave up. He pushed through every setback, every injury, and every defeat, determined to prove himself as a top basketball player.

And then, in the championship game of Max's second season, with just seconds left on the clock and his team down by two points, Max seized the opportunity of a lifetime. He dribbled the ball past the opposing team's defenders, faked a shot, and then made a perfect pass to his teammate who sunk the game-winning shot.

Max's team won the championship, and Max was hailed as a hero. His hard work, determination, and passion for basketball had led him to the top of the game, and he knew that he had achieved his childhood dream.

From that day forward, Max continued to play basketball with the same passion and dedication that had carried him to the top. And though he faced many challenges and obstacles along the way, he knew that with hard work and perseverance, anything was possible.
